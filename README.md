# IF_Tokenizer
Description: Object-Oriented Programming Project designed to parse a story from an HTML file. The source code was written with C++17.

Files Summary: The header and cpp files storytokenizer, passagetokenizer, and passagetoken are used to parse and break down the story from the HTML file. Then, the header and cpp files for the IFInterpreter are used to use the tokenizer objects, retrieve the story and play it. Finally, the play-driver file instantiates a IFInterpreter object to play the specified story. There are 2 sample IF files which can be used to test the tokenizer.
